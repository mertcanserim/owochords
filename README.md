# About the project


owoChord is a macro that targets the minigame of the discord bot called "owo"

I programmed this macro using python
and you can **check** my code because it is **open source**,it does not contain any malware or online backdoor.

I wanted to write this because while downloading or after downloading the exe version you may get a **virus warning**
because it does not have a reliable license because this is a hobby project.

if you want you can download the .py file directly, if you will do this make sure you have **keyboard**, **pyautogui** in your python library or it will not work

#

# WARNING

Sometimes, for bot protection, OwO will send you a private confirmation message, if this happens pause the bot and reply to the message.

If you don't answer the confirmation message, owo will give you 5 more replies. If you don't answer 5 more times, you will be suspended for 1 hour.
